A basic inventory problem requires balancing ordering costs and carrying costs to minimize total cost.  We are given a product's annual demand $D$ and we need to determine the quantity to order $Q$.\n","\n","Suppose that a fixed ordering cost of $K$ is incurred with each order, independent of the order size.  If the quantity ordered is $Q$ then the number of orders placed per year in $\\frac{D}{Q}$.  It then follows that the ordering cost per year is\n","\n","$\n","\\textrm{Ordering cost} = \\left( \\textrm{Cost per order} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\textrm{Orders per year} \\right)  = \\frac{KD}{Q}.\n","$\n","\n","By placing orders so that replenishing occurs just as stock is depleted, we ensure that the inventory level fluctuates between a low of zero and a high of $Q$.  The average inventory is therefore $\\frac{Q}{2}$.  Suppose also that items held in inventory incur an annual carrying cost of $h$.  (This cost is often expressed as a percentage of the product's unit cost, in the form $h = ic$, where $i$ denotes the carrying cost percentage, and $c$ denotes an item's cost.)  Then, the annual inventory carrying costs are\n","\n","$\n","\\textrm{Inventory cost} = \\left( \\textrm{Carrying charge} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\textrm{Average inventory} \\right)  = \\frac{hQ}{2}.\n","$\n","\n","Then, the average total cost (ATC) is the sum of the two components:\n","\n","$\n","\\textrm{ATC} = \\left( \\textrm{Ordering cost} \\right) + \\left( \\textrm{Inventory cost} \\right)  = \\frac{KD}{Q} + \\frac{hQ}{2}.\n","$\n","\n","This is for each product, but Woodstock needs to consider all four of the products that it sells.  The annual demands for these products range from 300 per year for a high-end vacuum cleaner to 30,000 per year for a table fan.
